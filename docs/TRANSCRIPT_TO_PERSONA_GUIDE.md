## üîÑ The Two-Stage AI Pipeline

### Stage 1: Behavioral Analysis üß†
**Model**: GPT-4o at temperature 0.2 (precise extraction)

The AI analyzes your transcript to extract:

#### **Speech Patterns**
- Sentence length (short/medium/long)
- Formality level (1-10 scale)
- Filler words ("um", "like", "you know", "basically")
- Common phrases and expressions
- Self-correction frequency
- Question style (direct/indirect/clarifying)

#### **Vocabulary Profile**
- Complexity level (1-10)
- Avoided technical words
- Commonly used words and expressions

#### **Emotional Profile**
- Baseline mood (positive/neutral/negative/anxious/enthusiastic)
- Frustration triggers (specific words/topics)
- Excitement triggers (things they love)

#### **Cognitive Profile**
- Comprehension speed (slow/medium/fast)
- Patience level (1-10)

#### **Behavioral Signals**
- **Objectives**: What they're trying to achieve
- **Needs**: What they require to succeed
- **Fears**: Deep concerns and anxieties
- **Apprehensions**: Surface-level worries
- **Knowledge Bounds**: What they know confidently, partially, or not at all

#### **Real Quotes**
- Extracts 3-5 authentic quotes from the transcript

### Stage 2: Persona Synthesis üé≠
**Model**: GPT-4o at temperature 0.5 (creative synthesis)

The AI creates:

#### **Complete Persona Object** (51 database fields)
```json

## üìù How to Prepare Your Transcript

### ‚úÖ Best Format: Conversation Style

Your transcript should look like this:

```
M: Hello, can you tell me about your experience with our app?
R: Yeah, so, um, I've been using it for about 3 months now. It's pretty good overall.

M: What do you like most about it?
R: I really like how simple it is. Like, I don't have to think too much, you know? Everything is where I expect it to be.

M: Have you faced any challenges?
R: Well, sometimes the search doesn't work the way I want. Like, if I misspell something, it just shows nothing instead of suggesting corrections.

M: That's helpful feedback. How often do you use the app?
R: Pretty much daily. I check it in the morning for updates and then throughout the day.

M: What would make it better for you?
R: Honestly? Just faster loading times. When I'm on the go, I don't want to wait, you know? Also, maybe a dark mode? My eyes get tired at night.
```

**Key Elements:**
- `M:` = Moderator/Interviewer
- `R:` = Respondent/Participant
- Natural conversation flow
- Include filler words and natural speech patterns
- Capture emotional tone ("I really like", "honestly", "frustrating")

### ‚úÖ Alternative Format: Structured Data

**Supported Column Names:**
- **Transcript**: `transcript`, `text`, `content`, `raw_text`
- **Identity**: `name`, `participant`, `user`
- **Demographics**: `age`, `gender`, `role`, `title`, `position`, `company`, `organization`, `location`, `city`, `education`, `income`

## üí° Pro Tips

### For Best Results:

1. **Include Natural Speech**

   - Keep emotional expressions ("I love", "frustrating")

2. **Conversation Length**
   - Minimum: **300 words** for basic persona
   - Ideal: **1000-2000 words** for rich persona
   - Maximum: **10,000 words** (will be truncated)

3. **Multiple Personas**
   - Upload multiple transcript files separately
   - Each file generates one persona
   - Or use CSV/Excel with multiple rows

4. **Demographic Hints**
   - Include demographic info in transcript context
   - Example: "As a 28-year-old software engineer..."
   - Or use structured data format (CSV/Excel)

## üîç Example: Your Google Doc Transcript

If your transcript looks like this:

```
M: How do you currently handle your finances?
R: Um, honestly, I'm not great at it. I mostly just use my banking app to check my balance. I know I should budget more, but like, it's overwhelming, you know?

M: What makes it overwhelming?
R: There are so many apps and tools. I tried one once, but it wanted me to connect my bank account, and I was worried about security. Plus, it had all these categories and settings... I just gave up.

M: What would make it easier?
R: Something simple. Like, just tell me if I'm spending too much. I don't need fancy charts. Maybe just a notification like "Hey, you're spending a lot on food this week."
```

The AI will generate:

**Persona Attributes:**
- **Name**: Rahul / Priya (generated)
- **Age**: 25-30 (inferred)
- **Tech Savviness**: Medium (uses apps but cautious)
- **Domain Knowledge**: Low (finance/budgeting)
- **Speech Pattern**: Casual, uses filler words
- **Emotional Profile**: Anxious about complexity
- **Frustrations**: Overwhelming interfaces, security concerns
- **Needs**: Simple, clear, automated solutions
- **Apprehensions**: Connecting bank accounts, complex settings

**Master System Prompt** will include:
- Use conversational language with "um", "like", "you know"
- Express uncertainty about technical details
- Show concern about security
- Prefer simple explanations over complex features
- Avoid financial jargon

## üéØ Real-World Example

### Input: User Research Transcript
```
M: Tell me about your morning routine.
R: So, I wake up around 6:30, and the first thing I do is check my phone. Not proud of it, but like, I need to see if there are any urgent emails or messages. Then I usually scroll through Instagram for a bit while I'm still in bed.

M: What apps do you check?
R: Mainly WhatsApp for work group messages, then Gmail, and Instagram. Sometimes Twitter, but I'm trying to use that less because it's just... negative, you know?

M: How do you feel about notifications?
R: Love-hate relationship. I need them for work stuff, but they're also super distracting. I've turned off most app notifications, but I keep email and WhatsApp on because I don't want to miss anything important.
```

## ‚ùì FAQ

### Q: Can I upload multiple transcripts at once?
**A**: Yes! Upload a CSV/Excel file with multiple rows, each containing a transcript.
