# Accurate Persona Extraction Fix

## ‚úÖ **Problem Solved: Persona Mismatch**

### **The Problem You Reported:**
```
‚ùå Uploaded: Abdul Yasser, 24, day trader from Bangalore
‚ùå Got: Raj, 41, Designer from Ranchi, Uttar Pradesh

COMPLETE MISMATCH!
```

---

## **Root Cause**

The `/api/agents/v5` endpoint was using its own AI logic that:
1. Generated random Indian demographics
2. Overrode the actual transcript data
3. Created completely fictional personas

**This was WRONG!** You need personas that match YOUR transcripts exactly.

---

## **The Solution**

Created a NEW endpoint: **`/api/accurate-transcript/upload`**

### **Key Features:**

1. **ZERO Temperature AI** (temperature: 0.0)
   - No creativity, no guessing
   - Pure extraction only

2. **Strict Extraction Rules**
   - ‚úÖ Extract ONLY what's explicitly stated
   - ‚úÖ Use EXACT names, ages, locations from transcript
   - ‚ùå NO inference or guessing
   - ‚ùå NO random generation

3. **Validates Against Transcript**
   - Only extracts from "Respondent:" sections
   - Ignores "Moderator:" sections
   - Returns exact quotes
