- **Vocabulary Filtering**: Replaces avoided words with simpler alternatives
- **Response Timing**: Calculates realistic delays based on comprehension speed and patience

### 5. **Dual API Views**
- **Short View**: Compact cards for grid/list displays with key metrics
- **Full View**: Complete persona profiles with all behavioral attributes

### 6. **SSE Chat Orchestration**
- Real-time streaming with typing indicators
- Session management with message history
- Human-like response timing and delivery
- Event-driven architecture for scalability

## ðŸ›  Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
Enhanced `ai_agents` table with 20+ JSONB columns for flexible persona storage:
- Demographics, traits, behaviors
- Objectives, needs, fears, apprehensions
- Communication style, speech patterns
- Vocabulary profile, emotional profile
- Cognitive profile, knowledge bounds
- Master system prompt

### Model-Agnostic Provider Gateway
```javascript
// Supports both OpenAI and Anthropic
const provider = getProvider(); // Based on AI_PROVIDER env var
const response = await provider.chat(messages, {
  temperature: 0.2,  // Low for analysis
  max_tokens: 1500
});
```

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/personas` - Create persona from transcript
- `GET /api/personas?view=short` - List personas (compact)
- `GET /api/personas/:id` - Get full persona details
- `PATCH /api/personas/:id/status` - Update lifecycle
