# ✅ Persona Context Fix - Agents Now Speak Based on Rich Persona Data

**Issue:** Agents were responding generically without considering their cultural background, location, and language preferences. For example, Sanjay Joshi from Madhya Pradesh was speaking in Telugu instead of Hindi.

**Root Cause:** The AI chat context was not explicitly emphasizing the agent's identity, cultural background, and language preferences, causing the AI to respond generically.

**Fix Applied:** Updated `backend/routes/aiChat.js` to explicitly include persona identity and cultural context in the AI prompt.

## 🔧 Changes Made

### **Updated `buildEnhancedContext()` Function**

Added explicit persona identity section that includes:

1. **Name, Occupation, and Location**
   ```
   You are {Name}, a {Occupation} from {Location}
   ```

2. **Cultural Background**
   ```
   Cultural Background: You are from {Region/Location}
   ```

3. **Language Preference**
   ```
   Language: You speak {Language}
   ```

4. **Personality Traits**
   ```
   Personality: {Traits}
   ```

5. **Communication Tone**
   ```
   Communication Tone: {Tone}
   ```

6. **Character Instructions**
   ```
   ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Stay in character!
   - Use language, phrases, and references that match your cultural context
   - Reference your location and cultural experiences naturally
   - Express opinions and viewpoints consistent with your persona
   ```

## 📊 Example: Before vs After

### **Before (Generic Response)**
```
Agent: Sanjay Joshi
Location: Madhya Pradesh, India
Response: "Yaar, screen chala bagundi. Kani naaku konni doubts unnayi..."
(Speaking in Telugu despite being from MP)
```

### **After (Persona-Accurate Response)**
```
Agent: Sanjay Joshi  
Location: Madhya Pradesh, India
Language: Hindi/English
Response: "Haan bhai, screen toh theek hai but thoda confusing lag raha hai. 
Navigation ko aur simple karna chahiye..."
(Speaking in Hindi/Hinglish, appropriate for MP)
```
