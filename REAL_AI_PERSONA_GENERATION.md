---

## **How It Works**

### **1. Frontend (Users Tab)**
- Click "Generate" button in the Users tab
- Paste your transcript in the modal
- Click "Generate Users"

### **2. Backend Processing**
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/agents/v5`
- **AI Model**: GPT-4o via LangChain
- **Process**:
  1. **Transcript Analysis**: Extracts behavioral signals using AI
  2. **Persona Synthesis**: Creates detailed persona with Indian demographics
  3. **Image Fetching**: Gets appropriate image from Unsplash
  4. **Database Storage**: Saves persona to PostgreSQL

### **3. Data Extraction**
The AI extracts from the **Respondent's answers only** (not Moderator):
- Name
- Age  
- Gender
- Occupation
- Location (with state)
- Pain points
- Goals
- Personality traits
- Key quotes
- And more...
