```

**Before**: "Read More" button in hover overlay
**After**: Entire card is clickable

- Removed unused `onStatusChange` and `onDelete` props from card component
- Simplified interaction model

## Technical Implementation

### Data Flow
```javascript
agents → filteredAgents → map to cards → click → modal
```

### Color Assignment
Each agent gets a color from the 8-color palette based on index:
```javascript
.map((agent, index) => ({
  ...agent,
  color: categoryColors[index % categoryColors.length]
}))
```

### Profession Icon Function
```javascript
const getProfessionIcon = (occupation) => {
  const occupationLower = (occupation || '').toLowerCase();
  
  if (occupationLower.includes('driver')) return TruckIcon;
  if (occupationLower.includes('manager')) return UserGroupIcon;
  // ... etc
  
  return BriefcaseIcon; // Default
};
```

### Card Component Structure
```
Card (clickable)
├── Colored Header
│   ├── Level Badges (Tech, English, Domain)
│   ├── Profession Icon (dynamic)
│   ├── Agent Full Name (bold, large)
│   ├── Occupation
│   └── Location & Age
└── Image Section
    ├── Agent Photo
    └── Hover Overlay with "Read More"
```

## Visual Improvements

### Responsive Grid
- **Mobile (< 768px)**: 1 column
- **Tablet (768px - 1024px)**: 2 columns  
- **Desktop (> 1024px)**: 4 columns

### Animation
- Staggered entry: Each card animates in with a slight delay
- Delay calculation: `(index % 8) * 0.05` seconds
- Creates wave effect for every 8 cards

### Badge Styling
- Smaller badges with `text-[10px]` for compact display
- Color-coordinated with card header gradient
- 20% opacity backgrounds for subtle appearance
- Border matching the gradient color
