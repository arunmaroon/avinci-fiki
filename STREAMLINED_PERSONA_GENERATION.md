## 📝 Usage Examples

### Sample Transcript
```
User Research Interview - Day Trader

Moderator: Hi, thanks for joining us today. Can you tell us about yourself?

Respondent: Hi! I'm Abdul Yasser, I'm 24 years old and I live in Bangalore, Karnataka. I work as a day trader, mostly dealing with stocks and crypto.

Moderator: What financial apps do you use?

Respondent: I use PhonePe for payments, Zerodha for trading, and I have accounts with HDFC and ICICI banks. I also use Slice Pay sometimes, but the hidden charges are a big problem.

Moderator: What are your main pain points with current financial tools?

Respondent: The biggest issue is hidden charges. You think you're getting a good deal, but then there are all these random fees. Also, the UI is often confusing - too many buttons and options everywhere. I prefer simple, clean interfaces that get straight to the point.
