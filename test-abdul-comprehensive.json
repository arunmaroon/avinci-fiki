  "transcript": "User Research Interview - Stock Market Trader\n\nModerator: Hi Abdul, thanks for joining us today. Can you tell us about yourself?\n\nRespondent: Hi! I am Abdul Yasser, I am 24 years old, male, and I live in Bangalore, Karnataka. I work as a stock market trader, mostly dealing with stocks and crypto. I started trading post-COVID with 1 lakh from my parents. Before this, I was an event manager. My income is around 30k per month, though it is very volatile - I made 50k profit in January but had 30k loss last month.\n\nModerator: What are your hobbies and interests?\n\nRespondent: I enjoy gyming, partying, traveling, trying different foods, and of course Bitcoin trading. I am quite social and like spending time with friends.\n\nModerator: What financial apps and banks do you use?\n\nRespondent: I use PhonePe and Google Pay for payments, Zerodha for trading. My bank is HDFC. For credit, I have Slice Pay with 70k limit and Dhani with 25k limit. I prefer online payments and avoid small credit transactions below 5k.\n\nModerator: What are your main challenges and pain points?\n\nRespondent: The biggest issue is hidden charges. For example, Dhani charges me 600 rupees per month which I did not expect. Also, recovery calls are very annoying, and loan processes are too lengthy. In terms of UI, many apps are lagging, have too many unnecessary form fields, and lack transparency about fees. I prefer simple, clean interfaces.\n\nModerator: What are your goals and motivations?\n\nRespondent: Short-term, I want quick loan approval and to expand my trading portfolio. Long-term, I want financial stability and to own a house. I want to be financially independent by 30. My family has always struggled with money, so I am determined to break that cycle. Money management is very important - if you invest even a single rupee at a wrong place then it will be a Greater Loss.\n\nModerator: Can you tell me about your daily routine?\n\nRespondent: In the morning, I check the stock market and do my trading. Afternoon is for gym or Bitcoin trading. Evening is for socializing and trying new foods at different places.\n\nModerator: How would you describe your family and social life?\n\nRespondent: My family is very close and supportive. My parents funded my trading, and my brothers help me during losses. I am social and enjoy partying and food outings with friends. We trust digital payments but are skeptical of traditional banking.\n\nModerator: Tell me about your background.\n\nRespondent: I am from Karnataka, Indian heritage. I believe in digital-first mindset and financial literacy. I prefer digital banking over traditional methods. I started my event management job in 2018 which gave me organizational skills, but I lost that job due to COVID in 2020, which is when I shifted to trading.\n\nModerator: How do you make decisions?\n\nRespondent: I am calculated and risk-averse in my approach. Past trading losses and family advice heavily influence my decisions. I stay calm under pressure and seek family support when needed.\n\nModerator: What would make you trust or distrust a financial service?\n\nRespondent: Transparent fees and reliable servers build my trust. Hidden charges and aggressive recovery calls break it completely. I value transparency, discipline, and financial literacy. I am skeptical of high-interest lenders and avoid unverified apps.\n\nModerator: How do you learn about new things?\n\nRespondent: I am self-taught, mostly through YouTube and certifications. I prefer online tutorials and peer advice. I am tech-savvy and fluent in English with Hinglish slang.\n\nModerator: What kind of communication do you prefer?\n\nRespondent: I prefer app chat and phone support. I expect 24-hour loan approval turnaround. My tone is practical but optimistic. I speak in conversational Hinglish and am fintech-savvy."
