# Persona Detail Modal - Complete Fix

## Problem Identified
The Airbnb-style detail modal was showing "Not documented" for most fields because:
1. **Wrong data extraction paths** - Modal was looking in `raw_persona` only
2. **Data is stored in BOTH places** - Some fields are at top-level, some in `raw_persona`
3. **Empty arrays vs. rich objects** - Top-level `hobbies` is `[]` but `raw_persona.hobbies_interests` has full data

## Data Structure in Database (Example: Aditya Singh)
```javascript
{
  // TOP-LEVEL FIELDS (direct access)
  "name": "Aditya Singh",
  "age": 33,
  "gender": "Male",
  "education": "B.Tech + MBA",
  "goals": ["Health improvement", "Personal growth"],
  "motivations": ["Recognition", "Financial security"],
  "hobbies": [],  // EMPTY! 
  "daily_routine": {  // HAS DATA HERE
    "weekday": {...},
    "weekend": {...}
  },
  "decision_making": {
    "style": "Analytical and data-driven",
    "process": [...]
  },
  "communication_style": {
    "tone": "Friendly",
    "phrases": [...]
  },
  
  // RAW_PERSONA OBJECT (nested, rich data)
  "raw_persona": {
    "hobbies_interests": {  // RICH DATA HERE!
      "primary": ["Fitness", "Cooking", "Photography"],
      "seasonal": ["Diwali celebrations"],
      "secondary": ["Personal finance", "Restaurants"]
    },
    "personality_traits": {
      "values": ["Growth", "Honesty"],
      "personality": ["Adaptable", "Strategic"]
    },
    "daily_routine": {  // ALSO HERE
      "weekday": {...}
    }
  }
}
```

## Fix Applied
Updated `AirbnbAgentDetailModal.jsx` to:

### 1. Extract from BOTH Locations
```javascript
const personality = agent.personality_traits || rawPersona.personality_traits || {};
const communication = agent.communication_style || rawPersona.communication_style || {};
const decisionMaking = agent.decision_making || rawPersona.decision_making || {};
const dailyRoutine = agent.daily_routine || rawPersona.daily_routine || {};
const hobbies = rawPersona.hobbies_interests || {};  // ONLY in raw_persona
```

### 2. Fixed Daily Routine Display
- Now properly sorts times chronologically
- Displays in readable format with color-coded times
- Shows scrollable list for long schedules
- Handles both 12-hour and 24-hour formats

### 3. Fixed Basic Information
- Gender: Now checks both `agent.gender` and `rawPersona.demographics.gender`
- Income Range: Checks both `agent.demographics.income_range` and `rawPersona.demographics.income_range`
- Properly formats values with `formatTitleCase()`

## What Now Shows Correctly

### âœ… Hobbies & Interests
- **Primary Interests**: "Fitness and gym workouts, Cooking traditional Indian dishes, Photography"
- **Seasonal Activities**: "Diwali celebrations and preparations, Holi festival with family"
- **Secondary Interests**: "Learning about personal finance, Exploring new restaurants"
